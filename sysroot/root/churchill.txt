We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas
and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the
air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the
beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight on the fields and
in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.
